## Phrase Generator for Ingested KBs
This project develops a tool to automate the generation of test phrases from knowledge based (KB) documents using OpenAIâ€™s language processing technologies. It aims to streamline the testing process by reducing manual effort in creating test cases. By extracting key information from documents, the tool will generate relevant testing phrases, making test preparation faster and improve test coverage. The goal is to create a tool that can be used with different testing frameworks, applicable to various tenants and domains.
